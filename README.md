# book_club_fe

## Get started
```
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npm start
```

By default the app will start on the below ports
```
localhost:8000/webpack-dev-server/bundle // The app
localhost:8001 // Code coverage
```

This needs to have https://github.com/garycarr/book_club_be.git for the backend.
